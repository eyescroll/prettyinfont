Many people believe that there is nothing fuller of pathos than Shakespeare’s tragedies, and I like to think that they are the same people who have never seen an adaptation of his works set in modern times – in high schools, where the real tragedies happen. I can name a couple of “Shakespeare-approved” masterpieces; however, I believe we can all agree on which is the superior adaptation – and that is undoubtedly **10 Things I Hate About You**.
